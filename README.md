# pyppbox_project

***pyppbox*** is an all-in-one Python toolbox which can be used for detecting, tracking, and re-identifying people with only a few lines of code. It is originally made for [***PoseTReID framework***](https://github.com/rathaumons/PoseTReID_DATASET) which can effectively track specific/certain people across multiple cameras or video scenes in distributed contexts of people interaction spaces such as malls or amusement parks, etc.

* ` pyppbox = Python + People + Toolbox `
* Design for both short and long term people detecting, tracking, and re-identifying.
* Integrate GUI for easy configuration and demo.
* Support dictionary and YAML/JSON configuration.
