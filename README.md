***pyppbox*** is an all-in-one Python toolbox which can be used for detecting, tracking, and re-identifying people. We are able to effectively track specific/certain people across multiple cameras or video scenes in distributed contexts of people interaction spaces such as schools, malls or parks, etc.



* ` pyppbox = Python + People + Toolbox `
* Design for both short and long term people detecting, tracking, and re-identifying.
* Integrate GUI for easy configuration and demo.
* Support dictionary and YAML/JSON configuration.
